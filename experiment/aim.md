### Aim of the experiment
To understand the principles of parallel matrix multiplication using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). This experiment demonstrates how a complex computational task can be divided among multiple processes to achieve faster execution times. By the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Understand the master-worker paradigm in parallel computing.
- Visualize the process of data distribution (scatter) and result collection (gather) in MPI.
- Analyze the effect of the number of processes and matrix size on the overall performance.
- Appreciate the benefits of parallel computing for solving large-scale problems.
